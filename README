ss2js
-----
A Scala compiler plugin (see http://www.scala-lang.org/node/140)
that generates JavaScript from a subset of Scala language.
It flags, as errors, constructs it does not handle.

There are a number of similar projects (s2js, j2js, Scala+GWT).
See http://altjs.org/ for many other alternatives.

The rational for this is:
	produce something simple and fast
	obvious correlation between source and generated code
	not target the whole scala language or library
	not target a particular third party library

Tested with OpenJDK 6 and Scala 2.9.1. SCALA_HOME must be set for ant.
It produces code that has been tested in Rhino and V8 (should be portable).

This is at an early stage of development
There is a useable language subset, although I would like to extend it.
More work is needed for the Scala library.
See Sample.scala for what can be done. Run ant and see JavaScript in bin dir.

Usage:
  scalac -classpath ss2js.jar -Xplugin:ss2js.jar -Yno-imports <files>

Limitations:
  Does not use the standard (Predef) imports, use import ss2js.global._
  Single compilation unit and package
  Single name (object, class, constructor, def, val, var) per JS scope
  Simple matches only (coressponding to JS switch)
  Matches, trys and multiline ifs are effectively statements not expressions
  Ordering of functions and classes is important for visibility
  Single untyped try catch case with no guard
  Unsupported:
    varargs, lazy, override val
    apply method, partial functions, operator overloading
    case classes, concrete traits, package objects
